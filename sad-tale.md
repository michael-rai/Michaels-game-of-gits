House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

This unfortunately did not happen and he died. Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin, and let me assure you HE WILL DEFINATELY NOT DIE!

Except for the fact that he DEFINATELY WILL DIE!
